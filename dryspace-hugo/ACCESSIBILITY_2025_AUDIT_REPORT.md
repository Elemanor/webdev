## User Impact Stories

### Sarah M. (Blind, JAWS user)
"I tried for 20 minutes to request a quote. The form has no labels, I can't tell what field I'm in, and when I submit, nothing happens. I called a competitor instead."

### James T. (Motor disabilities, voice control)
"The tiny tap targets are impossible. I can't select the service I need, and voice commands don't work. This site assumes everyone has perfect motor control."

### Maria L. (ADHD, cognitive disabilities)
"The constant animations make it impossible to read. I literally cannot focus on the content with things flying around. I had to leave the site."
