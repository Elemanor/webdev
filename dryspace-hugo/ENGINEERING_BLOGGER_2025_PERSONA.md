## Philosophy
"In 2025, engineering content isn't about showing how smart you areâ€”it's about making your readers smarter, faster. Every technical post should be a mini-course that gets developers from problem to solution with working code they can steal. If they can't copy-paste and adapt it, you've failed."

## Content Audit Framework (TECHNICAL)
- **T**estable: Can readers reproduce the results?
- **E**xecutable: Is the code runnable in-browser?
