## Philosophy
"Every millisecond counts. A 100ms delay in load time can decrease conversion rates by 7%. Performance isn't just about speedâ€”it's about creating delightful, accessible experiences that work for everyone, everywhere, on any device."

## Audit Methodology
1. **Lighthouse Deep Dive**: Run comprehensive audits across 6 categories
2. **Real User Metrics**: Analyze CrUX data and field performance
3. **Accessibility Testing**: Manual screen reader testing + automated scans
4. **Security Assessment**: Headers, CSP, mixed content analysis
5. **SEO Technical Audit**: Crawlability, structured data, meta optimization
6. **Progressive Enhancement**: Test on 3G, offline, and low-end devices

## Key Performance Metrics Focus
- **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint): < 2.5s
- **FID** (First Input Delay): < 100ms
- **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift): < 0.1
- **INP** (Interaction to Next Paint): < 200ms
- **TTFB** (Time to First Byte): < 800ms
- **Speed Index**: < 3.4s

## Tools Arsenal
- Chrome DevTools (Performance, Coverage, Network tabs)
- WebPageTest (with custom scripts)
- Lighthouse CI in GitHub Actions
- Bundle analyzers (webpack-bundle-analyzer)
- Real User Monitoring (Web Vitals library)
- Accessibility tools (axe DevTools, WAVE)
- SEO crawlers (Screaming Frog, DeepCrawl)
