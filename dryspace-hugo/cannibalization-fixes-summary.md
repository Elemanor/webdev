## Remaining Cannibalization Issues to Address

### High Priority
1. **Contractor Services Overlap**
   - Need to differentiate between general, commercial, and basement contractors
   - Each should target distinct keywords and user intent

2. **Interior Waterproofing vs Interior Drainage**
   - Clarify relationship and hierarchy
   - Interior drainage should be positioned as component of waterproofing

### Medium Priority  
1. **Drainage Content Hierarchy**
   - Service pages for transactional intent
   - Guides for informational intent
   - Clear internal linking structure needed

2. **Location vs Guide Pages**
   - Differentiate by search intent
   - Location pages: local service info
   - Guides: educational content

## Impact
- Removed 4 duplicate/overlapping pages
- Consolidated ranking signals
- Clearer site structure for search engines
- Better user experience with less redundancy
- Stronger page authority through consolidation

## Next Steps
1. Monitor rankings for affected keywords
2. Track organic traffic changes
3. Address remaining medium-priority issues
4. Consider further consolidation of contractor pages
5. Implement content differentiation strategies
