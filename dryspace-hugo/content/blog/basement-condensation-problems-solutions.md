"My basement walls are sweating!" This alarming discovery leads thousands of Toronto homeowners to wrongly assume they have foundation leaks. After investigating over 2,000 moisture problems and finding that 40% were actually condensation issues, not water infiltration, I'll teach you to identify, understand, and permanently solve basement condensation.

## Understanding Condensation Science

### What Is Condensation?

Condensation occurs when warm, moist air contacts a surface cooler than the air's dew point temperature. Water vapor in the air transforms into liquid water on the cold surface—exactly like a cold glass "sweating" on a hot day.

### The Dew Point Explained

The dew point is the temperature at which air becomes saturated and must release moisture. When surface temperatures drop below the dew point, condensation forms.

**Dew Point Examples:**
- Air: 20°C (68°F), 50% RH → Dew point: 9°C (48°F)
- Air: 20°C (68°F), 70% RH → Dew point: 14°C (57°F)
- Air: 25°C (77°F), 60% RH → Dew point: 17°C (63°F)

**This means:** In a 20°C basement with 70% humidity, any surface cooler than 14°C will develop condensation!

## Expert Summary

<div class="expert-conclusion">
  <h3>The Science of Dry Basements</h3>
  
  <p>"After 15 years in building science, I've learned that condensation is often more destructive than leaks because it's invisible until major damage occurs. The physics is simple: warm, moist air + cold surface = water. But the solutions require understanding the complex interaction of temperature, humidity, and air movement."</p>
  
  <p>"The biggest mistake I see is treating symptoms instead of causes. Wiping walls dry while ignoring 70% humidity is futile. Success requires controlling humidity below 55% in summer, properly insulating all cold surfaces, and maintaining good air circulation."</p>
  
  <p>"Remember: your basement isn't 'sweating'—it's telling you the air is too humid for the surface temperatures present. Listen to the science, implement comprehensive solutions, and you'll enjoy a dry, healthy basement year-round."</p>
  
  <p>"One final truth: there's no such thing as a 'little' condensation problem. What starts as occasional dampness becomes structural damage faster than most homeowners realize. Act now, act comprehensively, and protect your investment."</p>
