    <p><strong>Saved us during the worst possible time</strong></p>
    <p>"Our basement flooded at 11 PM on a Saturday during a thunderstorm. Tom from Dryspace arrived within 45 minutes with a crew. They immediately started pumping water and had temporary measures in place by midnight. The permanent interior system was installed the following week. It's been 6 months and we've been bone dry through several storms. Their emergency response was incredible."</p>

    <p><strong>Professional from start to finish</strong></p>
    <p>"We needed exterior waterproofing for our 1920s home but were concerned about our mature landscaping and neighbor relations. David Kim personally oversaw the project. They hand-dug around our 100-year-old oak, coordinated perfectly with our neighbors, and restored everything beautifully. The work took 10 days and you can't even tell they were here, except our basement is now completely dry."</p>

    <p><strong>Honest advice saved me thousands</strong></p>
    <p>"I called three companies. Two wanted to do unnecessary exterior work for $30,000+. Sarah from Dryspace explained exactly why interior waterproofing would work for my situation. She was right. $7,200 later, my 1960s basement is dry for the first time in years. I appreciate their honesty in not overselling."</p>
