## The True Cost of Waiting

Every hour of standing water increases damage exponentially:

<div class="damage-timeline">
  <div class="damage-stage">
    <h4>0-2 Hours</h4>
    <p>Water spreads, drywall wicks moisture</p>
    <span class="cost">Damage: $2,000-$5,000</span>
  </div>
  
  <div class="damage-stage">
    <h4>2-8 Hours</h4>
    <p>Flooring buckles, furniture damage begins</p>
    <span class="cost">Damage: $5,000-$15,000</span>
  </div>
  
  <div class="damage-stage warning">
    <h4>8-24 Hours</h4>
    <p>Mold growth starts, structural damage</p>
    <span class="cost">Damage: $15,000-$30,000</span>
  </div>
  
  <div class="damage-stage critical">
    <h4>24+ Hours</h4>
    <p>Extensive mold, possible condemnation</p>
