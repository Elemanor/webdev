## Common Winter Basement Emergencies We're Solving Today

<div class="emergency-grid">
  <div class="emergency-type">
    <h3>üßä Frozen Pipe Floods</h3>
    <p>Pipes in exterior walls burst, flooding basement. We stop water, extract, and install freeze-proof solutions.</p>
    <span class="stat">487 cases this winter</span>
  </div>
  
  <div class="emergency-type">
    <h3>üèîÔ∏è Ice Dam Backup</h3>
    <p>Roof ice dams force water through foundation. We redirect flow and seal entry points from inside.</p>
    <span class="stat">312 cases this winter</span>
  </div>
  
  <div class="emergency-type">
    <h3>üíß Frost-Thaw Cracks</h3>
    <p>Temperature swings open foundation cracks. Our flexible injection system works at -30¬∞C.</p>
    <span class="stat">856 cases this winter</span>
  </div>
  
  <div class="emergency-type">
    <h3>‚ö° Sump Pump Freeze</h3>
    <p>Discharge lines freeze, backing up system. We install heated lines and backup pumps immediately.</p>
    <span class="stat">234 cases this winter</span>
  </div>
</div>

## Why Winter Basement Problems Can't Wait

<div class="winter-risks">
  <div class="risk-item critical">
    <h4>Expanding Ice = Expanding Damage</h4>
    <p>Water in cracks freezes and expands 9%, widening cracks by up to 30% per freeze cycle. A 1mm crack becomes a 5mm crack by spring.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="risk-item critical">
    <h4>Mold Grows in Winter Too</h4>
    <p>Your heated basement + moisture = perfect mold conditions. Winter mold spreads faster due to closed windows and poor ventilation.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="risk-item critical">
    <h4>Foundation Failure Risk</h4>
    <p>Hydrostatic pressure doesn't stop in winter. Frozen ground actually increases pressure on foundation walls.</p>
  </div>
</div>
