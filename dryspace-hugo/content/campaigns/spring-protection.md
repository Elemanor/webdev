## Why Spring is Critical for Toronto Basements

<div class="unique-value-props">
  <div class="value-prop">
    <h3>The 72-Hour Window</h3>
    <p>When temperatures rise above 0¬∞C for 3 consecutive days, snowmelt accelerates exponentially. This is when 65% of annual basement flooding occurs.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="value-prop">
    <h3>Frozen Ground = Water Highway</h3>
    <p>Toronto's clay soil becomes impermeable when frozen, directing 100% of meltwater toward your foundation instead of absorbing it.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="value-prop">
    <h3>Ice Dam Effect</h3>
    <p>Ice in your weeping tiles blocks drainage, creating hydrostatic pressure that can crack foundations and force water through walls.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="value-prop">
    <h3>Storm System Overload</h3>
    <p>Toronto's aging storm sewers can't handle rapid snowmelt plus spring rain, causing backflow into basements across the city.</p>
  </div>
</div>
