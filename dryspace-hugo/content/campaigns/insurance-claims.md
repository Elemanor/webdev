## Why Insurance Companies Deny Basement Flooding Claims

<div class="denial-reasons">
  <div class="reason">
    <h3>‚ùå "Gradual Damage" Exclusion</h3>
    <p>They claim water damage happened over time, not suddenly</p>

  </div>
  
  <div class="reason">
    <h3>‚ùå "Lack of Maintenance"</h3>

    <p class="solution">‚úì We demonstrate proper maintenance history</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="reason">
    <h3>‚ùå "Ground Water" Exclusion</h3>
    <p>Many policies exclude water from outside sources</p>
    <p class="solution">‚úì We identify covered water sources often missed</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="reason">
    <h3>‚ùå "Documentation Issues"</h3>
    <p>Missing photos, receipts, or proof of damage</p>
    <p class="solution">‚úì We provide complete professional documentation</p>

## Insurance Claim FAQ

<div class="faq-section insurance">
  <details>
    <summary>What if my claim was already denied?</summary>
    <p>We successfully appeal 67% of denied claims. Our documentation and expertise often reveal coverage that was missed. We'll review your denial letter free of charge and advise on options.</p>
  </details>
  
  <details>
    <summary>How do you bill insurance directly?</summary>
    <p>As approved vendors, we submit invoices directly to your insurer. You pay only your deductible. We handle all paperwork, follow-ups, and payment collection from the insurance company.</p>
  </details>
  
  <details>
    <summary>What if insurance doesn't cover everything?</summary>
    <p>We maximize coverage first, then provide clear options for any gaps. Often, we find additional coverage sources or negotiate better settlements. We'll never proceed with uncovered work without your approval.</p>
  </details>
  
  <details>
    <summary>How long does the claim process take?</summary>
    <p>Emergency water removal starts immediately. Initial claim approval typically takes 3-7 days with our advocacy. Full restoration depends on scope but averages 2-3 weeks for most basements.</p>
  </details>
  
  <details>
    <summary>Will this increase my premiums?</summary>
    <p>One claim rarely affects premiums significantly. However, we also install prevention systems that can actually LOWER your premiums by 10-15% with a waterproofing certificate.</p>
