## Why Summer Inspections Reveal Hidden Problems

<div class="summer-advantages">
  <div class="advantage">
    <h3>Dry Conditions Expose Water Paths</h3>
    <p>Staining, efflorescence, and water trails are clearly visible when walls are dry. Spring's moisture masks these critical indicators.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="advantage">
    <h3>Cracks at Maximum Width</h3>
    <p>Summer heat expands cracks to their largest size, making hairline fractures visible. What's hidden in wet seasons becomes obvious now.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="advantage">
    <h3>Foundation Fully Accessible</h3>
    <p>No snow, ice, or spring mud. We can inspect every inch of your foundation, inside and out, including areas hidden other seasons.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="advantage">
    <h3>Perfect Repair Conditions</h3>
    <p>If issues are found, summer offers ideal weather for any repair method. Materials cure properly, work proceeds quickly.</p>
  </div>
</div>
