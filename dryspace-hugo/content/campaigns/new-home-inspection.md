## What General Home Inspectors Miss in Basements

<div class="missed-issues">
  <div class="issue critical">
    <h3>Early-Stage Foundation Cracks</h3>
    <p>General inspectors note visible cracks. We measure, analyze crack patterns, and predict future movement. The difference? Knowing if it's a $500 cosmetic issue or $15,000 structural problem.</p>
    <span class="stat">Missed by 87% of general inspections</span>
  </div>
  
  <div class="issue critical">
    <h3>Hidden Water Damage</h3>
    <p>Fresh paint and finished basements hide water history. Our moisture meters and thermal cameras see through coverings, revealing water damage sellers desperately concealed.</p>
    <span class="stat">Found in 71% of "dry" basements</span>
  </div>
  
  <div class="issue critical">
    <h3>Failing Waterproofing Systems</h3>
    <p>That sump pump might run, but is it the right size? Is the discharge proper? Are weeping tiles clogged? We test the entire system, not just what's visible.</p>
    <span class="stat">43% of "working" systems need replacement</span>
  </div>
  
  <div class="issue">
    <h3>Neighborhood Risk Factors</h3>
    <p>We know every Toronto neighborhood's water table, flood history, and soil type. Your inspector from Mississauga doesn't know The Beaches floods every spring.</p>
    <span class="stat">Location-specific risks in 82% of homes</span>
