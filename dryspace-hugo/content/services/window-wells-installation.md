That small basement window could be the difference between a legal bedroom and wasted space—or worse, between life and death in an emergency. After engineering over 500 window well installations across Toronto, from emergency egress systems to decorative garden wells, I'll guide you through everything you need to know about this critical basement feature.

<div class="code-alert">
  <h3>⚖️ Toronto Building Code Requirements</h3>
  <p>Every basement bedroom MUST have an egress window that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Opens to minimum 3.8 sq ft (0.35 m²)</li>
    <li>No dimension less than 15" (380mm)</li>
    <li>Sill height maximum 1.5m above floor</li>
    <li>Window well minimum 760mm from window</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="warning">Non-compliance = illegal suite, insurance issues, safety risk</p>
