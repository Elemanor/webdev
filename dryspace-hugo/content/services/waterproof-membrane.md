# Waterproof Membrane Installation: Ultimate Foundation Protection

<div class="quick-answer">
<p><strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Waterproof membranes are protective barriers applied to foundation walls to prevent water infiltration. Professional installation costs $8-15 per square foot and provides 25+ years of protection. Best installed during construction or as part of exterior waterproofing.</p>
</div>

Your foundation walls face constant assault from groundwater, freeze-thaw cycles, and soil pressure. A professionally installed waterproof membrane creates an impenetrable barrier that protects your investment for decades. After installing over 5,000 membrane systems across Toronto, we know which products and techniques deliver lasting protection.
