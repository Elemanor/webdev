Excavation is where every major construction project beginsâ€”and where many go wrong. After safely completing over 1,500 excavations across Toronto, from tight downtown lots to expansive suburban properties, I've learned that the difference between a smooth project and a disaster often comes down to the first few feet of digging.

## Types of Excavation Services

### Foundation Excavation

The most critical excavation type:

**Full Basement Excavation:**
- New construction

**Process:**
1. Site preparation and utilities locate
2. Topsoil stripping and storage
3. Bulk excavation to depth
4. Fine grading for footings
5. Drainage preparation
6. Access ramp creation

**Depth Considerations:**
- Standard basement: 8-9 feet
- Walk-out basement: 10-12 feet
- Frost line minimum: 4 feet

**Cost:** $50-100 per cubic yard

### Basement Lowering Excavation

**Underpinning Support:**
- Excavate in sections
- Support existing foundation
