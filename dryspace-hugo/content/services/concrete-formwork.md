Behind every perfect concrete structure in Toronto stands precision formwork‚Äîthe temporary molds that shape liquid concrete into permanent strength. After building forms for everything from simple house footings to complex architectural features across the GTA, I've learned that the difference between concrete that lasts centuries and concrete that fails in years often comes down to the quality of the formwork.
