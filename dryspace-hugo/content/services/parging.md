## What is Parging?

Parging is the application of a thin coat of mortar to masonry or concrete walls. This protective and decorative coating:

- **Seals surface pores** preventing water infiltration
- **Covers imperfections** creating smooth surfaces
- **Protects foundations** from weather damage
- **Improves appearance** with clean, uniform finish

Think of parging as makeup for your foundation‚Äîit covers flaws while providing essential protection against moisture and deterioration.
