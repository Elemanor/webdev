Concrete is incredibly strong, but it's not indestructible. Toronto's freeze-thaw cycles, road salt, soil movement, and time itself take their toll. After 20 years diagnosing and fixing every type of concrete failure imaginable‚Äîfrom hairline cracks that let water destroy foundations to complete structural failures threatening building safety‚ÄîI know that timely, proper repair can add decades to your concrete's life and save you tens of thousands in replacement costs.

## Foundation Crack Repair

### The Most Critical Repairs

Foundation cracks aren't just cosmetic‚Äîthey're pathways for water destruction:

**Types of Foundation Cracks:**
- **Vertical Cracks**: Usually from settlement
- **Horizontal Cracks**: Serious‚Äîindicate pressure
- **Diagonal Cracks**: Often from differential settlement
- **Step Cracks**: Common in block walls
- **Spider Cracks**: Surface shrinkage

**Our Repair Methods:**

### 1. Epoxy Injection

**Best For:** Structural cracks in poured walls

**Process:**
1. Clean and prep crack
2. Install injection ports
3. Seal crack surface
4. Inject epoxy under pressure
5. Fill entire crack depth
6. Remove ports and finish

**Benefits:**
- Structural strength restored
- Waterproof seal
- Permanent repair
- No excavation needed
- Warranty provided

**Cost:** $400-$800 per crack

### 2. Polyurethane Injection

**Best For:** Active water leaks

**Process:**
1. Drill injection points
2. Install packers
3. Inject expanding foam
4. Seal water instantly
5. Follow with epoxy if needed

**Benefits:**
- Stops active water
- Flexible seal
- Quick cure
- Expands to fill voids
- Interior application

**Cost:** $350-$700 per crack

### 3. Carbon Fiber Reinforcement

**Best For:** Structural reinforcement

**Application:**
1. Grind surface smooth
2. Apply epoxy primer
3. Install carbon fiber strips
4. Saturate with resin
5. Apply protective coating
