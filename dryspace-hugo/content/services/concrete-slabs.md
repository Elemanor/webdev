A concrete slab is more than just a floor‚Äîit's the foundation of your daily life, whether it's the garage floor that supports your vehicles, the basement slab that keeps your home dry, or the patio where you gather with family. After pouring over 10,000 slabs across Toronto, from tiny shed pads to massive warehouse floors, I know what separates a slab that stays perfectly flat and crack-free for decades from one that fails within months.
