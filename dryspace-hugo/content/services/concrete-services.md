A: Usually yes for driveways, sometimes for patios. We handle all permit applications.

**Q: How do I prevent cracks?**
A: Proper base preparation, control joints, correct mix design, and good drainage are key.

**Q: What maintenance is required?**
A: Annual cleaning, crack sealing as needed, resealing every 2-3 years for decorative concrete. See our <a href="/guides/concrete-maintenance-guide">maintenance guide</a>.

**Q: Can you match existing concrete?**
A: We can get close with color and texture, though exact matches are difficult due to aging.
