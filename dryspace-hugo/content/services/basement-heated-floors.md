## Understanding Radiant Floor Heating

### How It Works

Heat rises from below for perfect comfort:

**The Science:**
- Entire floor becomes radiator
- Heat transfers via radiation
- Warms objects, not just air
- Even temperature distribution
- No cold spots or drafts

**Temperature Profile:**
- Floor surface: 25-29¬∞C
- Ankle level: 22-24¬∞C
- Head level: 20-22¬∞C
- Ceiling: 18-20¬∞C
- Perfect comfort gradient

**Why Basements Need It:**
- Concrete naturally cold
- Below-grade location
- Limited natural heat
- Moisture concerns
- Comfort essential

## Hydronic (Water) Systems

   - Remote access
   - Schedule programming

**Installation Process:**
1. **Design Layout**
   - Heat loss calculation
   - Tube spacing (6-12")
   - Zone planning
   - Manifold location
   - Control strategy

2. **Insulation Layer**
   - 2" rigid foam minimum
   - R-10 or higher
   - Vapor barrier
   - Perimeter insulation
   - Thermal break

3. **Tube Installation**
   - Secure to wire mesh
   - Proper spacing
   - Smooth bends
   - Pressure test
   - Photo documentation

4. **Concrete Pour**
   - 1.5" minimum over tubes
   - Careful placement
   - No tube damage
   - Proper curing
