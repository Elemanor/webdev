Proper site grading is your home's first and most important defense against water damage. After grading over 2,000 Toronto properties—and seeing firsthand how incorrect grading causes 60% of basement water problems—I can tell you that getting the slope right saves tens of thousands in future repairs.

## Understanding Site Grading

### What Is Proper Grading?

Site grading creates the correct slope around your property to direct water away from your foundation:

**Key Requirements:**
- 6" vertical drop in first 10 feet from foundation
- 2% minimum slope (2" per 10 feet)
- Continuous positive drainage
- No low spots or depressions
- Integration with neighboring properties

**The Science:**
- Water follows gravity
- Positive slope = water flows away
- Negative slope = water flows toward house
- Standing water = foundation problems
- Proper grading = dry basement

### Signs You Need Regrading

**Obvious Problems:**
- Water pooling near foundation
- Basement leaks after rain
- Soggy areas in yard
- Visible slope toward house
- Erosion patterns

**Subtle Indicators:**
- Efflorescence on basement walls
- Musty basement smell
- Cracks in foundation
- Doors/windows sticking
- Higher humidity indoors

## Our Site Grading Process

**Survey & Measurement:**
- Laser level survey
- Elevation mapping
- Drainage pattern analysis
- Problem area identification
- Photo documentation

**Deliverables:**
- Existing grade map
- Problem area report
- Proposed grade plan
- Cost estimate
- Timeline projection

### Step 2: Design & Planning

**Grading Plan Development:**
- Calculate earth movement
- Design drainage paths
- Integrate with landscaping
- Consider utilities
- Plan access routes

**Coordination Requirements:**
- Utility locates
- Neighbor consultation
- City requirements
- Tree protection
- Permit needs

### Step 3: Excavation & Rough Grading

**Earth Moving:**
- Strip existing sod/vegetation
- Excavate high areas
- Fill low areas
- Compact in lifts
- Create proper slopes

**Equipment Used:**
- Skid steer loader
- Mini excavator
- Compactor
- Laser level
- Hand tools

### Step 4: Fine Grading

**Precision Work:**
- Final slope adjustment
- Smooth surface creation
- Transition areas
- Edge definition
- Quality control

**Accuracy Standards:**
- ± 1/2" tolerance

- Ready for finishing

### Step 5: Surface Finishing

**Options Include:**
- Topsoil and sod
- Seed and straw
