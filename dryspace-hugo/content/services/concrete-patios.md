Your backyard deserves to be more than just grass and garden‚Äîit should be your personal retreat, your entertainment hub, your outdoor living room. After designing and installing over 1,000 concrete patios across Toronto, from cozy urban courtyards in Trinity Bellwoods to sprawling entertainment spaces in North York, I've mastered the art of creating patios that aren't just beautiful today, but stay stunning through decades of Toronto's harsh weather.
