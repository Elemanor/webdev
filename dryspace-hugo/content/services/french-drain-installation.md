# French Drain Installation: Engineering Water Away from Your Toronto Home

Water always wins—unless you give it somewhere better to go. After engineering drainage solutions for over 2,000 Toronto properties, from ravine lots in Rosedale to clay-heavy yards in Scarborough, I've learned that a properly designed French drain system is often the most elegant solution to persistent water problems.

Named after Henry French (not the country), who popularized this drainage method in 1859, French drains remain one of the most effective ways to manage surface and subsurface water before it threatens your foundation.

## Why Toronto Properties Need French Drains

### Our Unique Drainage Challenges

Toronto's geography and development create perfect conditions for drainage problems:

**Clay Soil Complications**
- Poor natural drainage
- Water sits on surface
- Hydrostatic pressure builds
- Foundation stress increases

**Urban Development Impact**
- Altered natural drainage
- Neighbor runoff issues
- Overwhelmed storm sewers
- Reduced ground absorption

**Topographical Challenges**
- Ravine properties
- Negative grading
- Low-lying areas
- Natural collection points

### Signs You Need a French Drain

**Immediate Indicators:**
- Standing water after rain
- Soggy lawn areas
- Water pooling near foundation
- Basement dampness/seepage
- Erosion patterns

**Seasonal Problems:**
- Spring flooding
- Ice buildup in winter
- Mosquito breeding grounds
- Dead grass from oversaturation
- Muddy areas persist

**Structural Concerns:**
- Foundation cracks developing
- Basement humidity rising
- Efflorescence on walls
- Doors/windows sticking
- Concrete heaving

**Typical Cost**: $30-40 per linear foot

### 2. Deep French Drains (Subsurface Water)

**Depth**: 4-6 feet
**Purpose**: Lower water table, foundation protection
**Best For**:
- High water tables
- Serious seepage
- Foundation water pressure
- Basement water issues

**Typical Cost**: $50-70 per linear foot

**Purpose**: Intercept hillside water
**Best For**:
- Sloped properties
- Ravine lots
- Uphill water sources
- Property boundaries

**Typical Cost**: $40-60 per linear foot

## How French Drains Work {#how-it-works}

### The Science of Water Management

French drains operate on simple physics principles:

1. **Water Follows Least Resistance**
   - Gravel provides easy path
   - More attractive than soil
   - Faster than clay percolation

2. **Gravity Does the Work**
   - Proper slope essential (1-2%)
   - Water flows downhill
   - No pumps needed

3. **Collection and Conveyance**
   - Perforated pipe gathers water
   - Smooth interior channels flow
   - Exits to safe location

### Component Breakdown

**The Trench**
- Width: 8-12 inches typically
- Depth: Varies by application
- Slope: 1% minimum (1" per 8 feet)
- Lined with landscape fabric

**The Pipe**
- 4" perforated PVC standard
- Holes face down (counterintuitive but correct)
- Rigid, not corrugated
- Smooth interior critical

**The Aggregate**
- 3/4" clear stone ideal
- No fines to clog system
- 2" below and above pipe
- Acts as filter and conductor

**The Fabric**
- Non-woven geotextile
- Prevents soil infiltration
- Allows water passage
- Extends system life
