Concrete is the backbone of every Toronto building‚Äîfrom the foundations that support your home to the sidewalks you walk on daily. After pouring over 50,000 cubic yards of concrete across the GTA and managing crews through every type of weather Toronto can throw at us, I know what separates concrete that lasts a century from concrete that cracks within a year.
