# Interior Drainage Systems: Year-Round Basement Protection

<div class="quick-answer">
<p><strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Interior drainage systems manage water that enters your basement by channeling it to a sump pump for removal. Installation costs $80-120 per linear foot, takes 2-3 days, and comes with a lifetime warranty. No exterior excavation needed.</p>
</div>

When exterior waterproofing isn't feasible or cost-effective, an interior drainage system provides reliable water management without disrupting your landscaping or requiring major excavation. Our proven systems have protected over 5,000 Toronto basements from water damage.

## How Interior Drainage Works

### The Science of Water Management

**System Components:**
1. **Perimeter Channel** - Collects water at floor/wall joint
2. **Drainage Pipe** - Carries water to sump pit
3. **Sump Pump** - Removes collected water
4. **Vapor Barrier** - Directs wall moisture to system
5. **Discharge Line** - Safely routes water away

**Operating Principle:**
- Water enters through walls/floor
- Flows to lowest point (drainage channel)
- Collected in perimeter system
- Pumped out automatically
- Continuous protection 24/7
