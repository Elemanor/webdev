## Understanding Exterior Waterproofing

### The Science of External Protection

Exterior waterproofing creates an impermeable barrier around your foundation, preventing water from ever touching your basement walls. Think of it as giving your home a waterproof jacket that works 24/7, regardless of weather conditions.

**The Multi-Layer Defense System:**
1. **Excavation** reveals the foundation
2. **Preparation** ensures proper adhesion
3. **Membrane** creates waterproof barrier
4. **Protection Board** shields membrane
5. **Drainage System** channels water away
6. **Proper Backfill** maintains effectiveness

### Why It's the Premium Choice

Through my engineering background and field experience, I've seen why exterior waterproofing provides superior protection:

**Addresses Root Causes**
- Stops hydrostatic pressure at source
- Prevents water penetration entirely
- Protects foundation structure
- Eliminates interior moisture

**Long-Term Value**
- 25-40 year lifespan
- Minimal maintenance required
- No mechanical systems to fail
- Increases property value significantly

## Our Advanced Exterior Waterproofing Process

### Step 1: Comprehensive Planning & Permits

Every project begins with detailed engineering:
- Utility location and marking
- Permit applications (we handle everything)
- Neighbor notifications when required
- Equipment access planning
- Tree and landscape protection strategy

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks for approvals

### Step 2: Professional Excavation

This is where experience matters most:
- Careful excavation to footing level
- Shoring installation if required
- Soil management and disposal
- Foundation exposure and cleaning
- Structural assessment

**Depth**: Typically 6-10 feet in Toronto
**Duration**: 1-2 days depending on size

### Step 3: Foundation Preparation

Critical for long-term success:
- Pressure washing entire surface
- Crack repair with hydraulic cement
- Parging application where needed
- Surface priming for membrane adhesion
- Corner and detail preparation

**Our Standard**: Surface must be clean, smooth, and structurally sound

### Step 4: Membrane Installation

The heart of exterior waterproofing:

**Our Premium System Includes:**
- Rubberized asphalt membrane (60mm thick)
- Self-healing technology for minor punctures
- UV-resistant top layer
- Root-resistant additives
- Seamless application

**Installation Process:**
1. Primer application
2. Membrane rolling/spraying
3. Detail work around penetrations
4. Protection board installation
5. Quality inspection

### Step 5: Advanced Drainage System

Modern drainage exceeds old standards:

**Components:**
- 4" rigid PVC weeping tile (not corrugated)
- Filter fabric sock
- 3/4" clear gravel surround
- Cleanout access ports
- Connection to storm or sump

**Toronto Modification**: Extra drainage at frost line to handle freeze-thaw

### Step 6: Proper Backfilling

Often overlooked but crucial:
- Graded gravel layers
- Compaction every 12 inches
- Final grade sloping away
- Topsoil and sod restoration
- Hard surface repair

## Exterior Waterproofing Costs in Toronto
