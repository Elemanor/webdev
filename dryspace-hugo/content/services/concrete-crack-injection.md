That crack in your concrete isn't just a cosmetic issueâ€”it's a highway for water, and in Toronto's climate, water in cracks means trouble. After performing over 3,000 injection repairs across the GTA, I can tell you that the right injection method makes the difference between a permanent fix and a recurring nightmare.

Modern injection technology allows us to seal cracks from hairline to 3 inches wide, restore structural integrity, and do it all without excavation. Let me show you how we match the perfect injection solution to your specific crack problem.

## Understanding Crack Injection Technology

### How Injection Works

Crack injection involves:
1. **Surface Preparation**: Clean and prep crack surface
2. **Port Installation**: Place injection ports along crack
3. **Seal Surface**: Apply surface seal between ports
4. **Inject Material**: Pump resin under pressure
5. **Full Penetration**: Material fills entire crack depth

The key? Using the right material for your specific situation.

## Polyurethane vs. Epoxy: Choosing the Right Solution

### Polyurethane Injection

**Best For:**
- Active water leaks
- Non-structural cracks
- Moving cracks
- Wet conditions

**How It Works:**
Polyurethane reacts with water to expand 5-40 times its volume, creating a flexible, waterproof seal that moves with your foundation.

**Advantages:**
- Stops active leaks immediately
- Remains flexible permanently
- Works in wet conditions
- Accommodates movement
- Deep penetration

**Technical Specs:**
- Expansion ratio: 500-4000%
- Tensile strength: 200-800 PSI
- Elongation: 100-600%
- Cure time: 15-45 minutes

### Epoxy Injection

**Best For:**
- Structural cracks
- Dry conditions
- Load transfer needed
- Permanent rigidity required

**How It Works:**
Two-part epoxy creates a structural bond stronger than concrete itself, essentially welding the crack closed.

**Advantages:**
- Restores structural integrity
- Stronger than concrete
- Permanent repair
- Chemical resistant
- No shrinkage

**Technical Specs:**
- Compressive strength: 10,000+ PSI
- Tensile strength: 7,000+ PSI
- Bond strength: 3,000+ PSI
- Cure time: 24-72 hours

## Our Injection Process

### 1. Professional Assessment
Every crack tells a story:
- Crack width and depth measurement
- Movement monitoring
- Water activity assessment
- Structural evaluation
- Cause determination

### 2. Preparation Phase
Proper prep ensures success:
- High-pressure water cleaning
- Grinding for port adhesion
- Moisture testing
- Surface sealing
- Port spacing calculation

### 3. Injection Execution
Precision application:
- Low-pressure injection (20-40 PSI)
- Bottom-up progression
- Full saturation verification
- Quality control checks
- Overflow monitoring

### 4. Finishing Touches
Professional completion:
- Port removal
- Surface grinding
- Aesthetic restoration
- Final inspection
- Warranty documentation

## Specialized Injection Applications

### Cold Joint Injection
Where walls meet footings:
- High-pressure zones
- Common leak points
- Requires special techniques
- Often needs curtain grouting

### Honeycomb Repair
Porous concrete areas:
- Multiple injection points
- Deep penetration required
- Structural concerns
- Extended injection times

### Window Well Cracks
Around basement windows:
- Multi-directional stress
- Waterproofing critical
- Often requires excavation
- Drainage improvements

### Pipe Penetrations
Where utilities enter:
- Flexible seal needed
- Movement expected
- Oakum removal
- Permanent solutions

## Cost Factors

### Polyurethane Injection Pricing
- **Basic crack (up to 8 ft)**: $400-600
- **Standard crack (8-12 ft)**: $600-900
- **Complex crack (corners/floors)**: $900-1,500
- **Emergency service**: +$150-300

### Epoxy Injection Pricing
- **Structural crack (up to 8 ft)**: $500-800
- **Standard crack (8-12 ft)**: $800-1,200
- **Complex geometry**: $1,200-2,000
- **Load-bearing repairs**: $1,500-3,000

### Additional Considerations
- Multiple crack discounts: 10-20%
- Warranty options: Included-$500
- Excavation if needed: $2,000-5,000
- Interior finishing: $500-2,000

## When Injection Isn't Enough

Some situations require additional solutions:

### Active Movement
If cracks continue growing:
- Foundation underpinning
- Soil stabilization
- Drainage improvements
- Structural reinforcement

### Multiple Cracks
Extensive cracking may indicate:
- Systemic foundation issues
- Waterproofing system failure
- Major structural problems
- Need for comprehensive solution

### Water Table Issues
High water pressure requires:
- Exterior waterproofing
- Drainage systems
- Sump pump installation
- Pressure relief

### Injection Pressure Calculations
Proper pressure prevents:
- Concrete damage
- Incomplete filling
- Material waste
- Surface blowouts

### Quality Control Measures
Every injection includes:
- Pressure monitoring
- Flow rate tracking
- Temperature checks
- Cure verification

## Warranty & Guarantees

## Case Studies

### Case 1: Century Home in Cabbagetown
**Problem**: 20-foot vertical crack, active leaking
**Solution**: Polyurethane injection with surface sealing
**Result**: Permanent seal, preserved interior finishes
**Cost**: $1,200

### Case 2: High-Rise Parking Garage
**Problem**: Structural cracks in support columns
**Solution**: High-strength epoxy injection
**Result**: Full structural restoration

## Making the Right Choice

Consider these factors:

1. **Water Activity**: Active = polyurethane
2. **Structural Needs**: Load-bearing = epoxy
3. **Crack Movement**: Moving = flexible seal
4. **Future Plans**: Finishing? Consider aesthetics
5. **Budget**: Balance cost with permanence
