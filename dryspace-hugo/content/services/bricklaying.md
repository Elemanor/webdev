From matching 1890s handmade bricks in Cabbagetown to building modern architectural features in Forest Hill, quality brickwork is both art and science. After laying over 2 million bricks across Toronto and training three generations of masons, I can tell you this: good brickwork lasts centuries, poor brickwork fails in years.
