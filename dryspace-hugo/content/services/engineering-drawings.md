Behind every safe renovation, addition, or structural modification in Toronto stands a set of engineering drawings that transform ambitious ideas into buildable reality. After engineering over 3,000 residential and commercial projects‚Äîfrom removing load-bearing walls in century homes to designing modern additions‚ÄîI know that quality engineering drawings are the difference between smooth approvals and costly delays.
