Water damage strikes fast and destroys everything in its path. In the 15 years I've led Toronto's premier emergency response team, I've seen how the difference between professional restoration and DIY attempts can mean $50,000 in prevented damage. Whether it's a burst pipe at 3 AM or a sewage backup during dinner, we're equipped to handle any water emergency.
