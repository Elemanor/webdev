    <h2>The Beaches Mystery: 30 Years of Unexplained Flooding</h2>
    <div class="case-meta">
      <span class="location">The Beaches, Toronto</span>
      <span class="date">Solved: March 2024</span>

  <div class="case-content">
    <div class="problem-section">
      <h3>The Challenge</h3>
      <p>For three decades, this 1890s Victorian experienced random basement flooding with no apparent pattern. Previous contractors blamed everything from the foundation to the weather, installing various solutions that all failed. The homeowners had spent over $40,000 on unsuccessful repairs.</p>
      
      <div class="symptoms">
        <h4>Symptoms:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Flooding 2-3 times yearly, but not during heavy rain</li>
          <li>Water appeared in different locations each time</li>
          <li>No correlation with weather patterns</li>
          <li>Previous waterproofing systems failed</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="investigation-section">
      <h3>Our Investigation</h3>
      <p>Standard water tests revealed nothing. We expanded our investigation:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Historical property research uncovered pre-1900 creek bed</li>
        <li>Ground-penetrating radar found old wooden culvert system</li>
        <li>Dye testing traced water path through 130-year-old infrastructure</li>
        <li>Discovered connection to storm surges from Lake Ontario</li>
      </ol>
      
      <div class="finding">
        <strong>Root Cause:</strong> Abandoned wooden storm culvert created underground channel directing lake surge water to foundation during specific wind/tide conditions.
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="solution-section">
      <h3>The Solution</h3>
      <p>We designed a multi-layer approach addressing the unique underground water pathway:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Deep curtain drain to intercept culvert flow</li>
        <li>Reinforced interior system with oversized pumps</li>
        <li>Smart monitoring connected to lake level data</li>
        <li>Automatic activation based on surge conditions</li>
      </ul>
      
      <div class="implementation">
        <h4>Installation Details:</h4>
        <p>5-day installation requiring coordination with city archaeologists to document historical infrastructure. System designed to handle 100-year surge events.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="results-section">
      <h3>Results</h3>
      <div class="outcome">
        <p>✓ Zero flooding through 8 surge events in first year</p>
        <p>✓ System activated automatically 11 times</p>
        <p>✓ Homeowners report "first dry year in 30"</p>
        <p>✓ Historical culvert preserved and documented</p>

    <h3>Investigation Process</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Visual Inspection:</strong> Unusual deterioration patterns, chemical deposits</li>
      <li><strong>Historical Research:</strong> Discovered industrial use 1890-1965</li>
      <li><strong>Soil Testing:</strong> pH levels 3.2-3.8 (extremely acidic)</li>
      <li><strong>Water Analysis:</strong> High sulfate content, industrial contaminants</li>
      <li><strong>Concrete Core Sampling:</strong> Chemical attack throughout wall thickness</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Technical Findings</h3>
    <div class="findings-grid">
      <div class="finding">
        <h4>Soil Contamination</h4>
        <p>Century of soap production left acidic residues that standard waterproofing couldn't withstand</p>
      </div>
      <div class="finding">
        <h4>Sulfate Attack</h4>
        <p>High sulfate groundwater causing concrete cancer - expanding and crumbling foundation</p>
      </div>
      <div class="finding">
        <h4>Membrane Failure</h4>
        <p>Previous waterproofing dissolved in acidic conditions within 6 months</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Engineered Solution</h3>
    <div class="solution-components">
      <h4>1. Chemical-Resistant Barrier System</h4>

        <li>Oversized sump pit with protective coating</li>
        <li>Chemical-duty pumps</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>3. Monitoring System</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>pH sensors at multiple points</li>
        <li>Alert system for chemical changes</li>
        <li>Annual water testing protocol</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Implementation Challenges</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Required hazmat protocols for contaminated soil</li>
      <li>Coordination with Ministry of Environment</li>
      <li>Custom-ordered chemical-resistant materials</li>
      <li>Specialized crew training for installation</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Results & Follow-Up</h3>
    <div class="results-data">
      <p><strong>Immediate:</strong> Complete water stoppage, pH neutralized at foundation</p>
      <p><strong>6 Months:</strong> No deterioration, membrane integrity confirmed</p>
      <p><strong>1 Year:</strong> First passed annual inspection in property history</p>
      <p><strong>Current:</strong> 2+ years with zero issues, concrete stabilized</p>
