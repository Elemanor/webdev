# About Dryspace: 25 Years Protecting Toronto Homes

    <h2>A Message from Our Founder</h2>
    <p>"In 1998, after my own basement flooded for the third time, I realized Toronto needed a waterproofing company that truly understood our unique challenges. That frustration became Dryspace—and 10,000 dry basements later, we're still driven by the same mission: protecting your home like it's our own."</p>

## Our Story: From Flooded Basement to Industry Leader

### The Beginning (1998)

It started with a problem I couldn't ignore. My Leslieville home, built in 1952, had chronic basement flooding. Three different contractors failed to solve it, each blaming the previous repair. Frustrated and out $15,000, I decided to figure it out myself.

As a professional engineer, I approached the problem systematically. I discovered Toronto's clay soil, freeze-thaw cycles, and aging infrastructure created unique challenges that generic solutions couldn't address. After months of research and testing, I developed what would become our ClimateGuard™ system.

### Building Trust (1998-2005)

Starting with just myself and one helper, we focused on:
- Understanding each home's specific challenges
- Developing Toronto-specific solutions
- Providing honest assessments and fair pricing
- Standing behind our work with real warranties

Word spread quickly. By 2005, we had grown to 12 employees and had protected over 1,000 Toronto homes.

### Innovation & Growth (2005-2015)

As we grew, we never forgot our roots. Key milestones:
- **2007**: Developed ClimateGuard™ technology
- **2009**: Opened North York facility
- **2011**: Launched 24/7 emergency response
- **2013**: Introduced lifetime transferable warranty
- **2015**: Reached 5,000 homes protected

### Industry Leadership (2015-Present)

Today, Dryspace is Toronto's most trusted waterproofing company:
- 47 dedicated professionals
- 5 service centers across GTA
- 10,000+ successful projects
- 99.2% customer satisfaction rate
- Zero unresolved BBB complaints
