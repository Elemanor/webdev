# The Lifetime Warranty That Actually Means Lifetime

Most "lifetime" warranties aren't worth the paper they're printed on. Limited to 10-25 years, void when you sell, filled with exclusions that deny every claim. Our warranty is different‚Äîit's designed to actually protect your investment for as long as you own your home, then transfer seamlessly to protect the next owner too.
