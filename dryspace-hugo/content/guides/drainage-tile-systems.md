# Drainage Tile Systems: Protecting Your Foundation from Water Damage

Drainage tile systems are the cornerstone of effective foundation waterproofing. These perimeter drainage networks collect and redirect groundwater away from your home, preventing basement flooding, foundation damage, and structural issues. Understanding how these systems work helps Toronto homeowners maintain dry, healthy basements.

## What Are Drainage Tile Systems?

Despite the name, modern drainage "tiles" aren't tiles at all. They're perforated pipes installed around your foundation's perimeter to manage groundwater. The term originates from the 1800s when actual clay tiles were laid end-to-end to create drainage channels.

### System Components

**Complete Drainage Tile System:**
1. **Perforated pipe** (4-6 inch diameter)
2. **Gravel bed** (¾" washed stone)
3. **Filter fabric** (prevents clogging)
4. **Solid discharge pipes**
5. **Termination point** (sump pit/daylight)
6. **Cleanouts** (maintenance access)

## How Drainage Tile Systems Work

### The Water Management Process

**Step-by-Step Operation:**
1. Groundwater rises around foundation
2. Water enters through pipe perforations
3. Gravity guides water through system
4. Collected water flows to discharge
5. Sump pump or gravity outlet removes water

### Physics Behind the System

**Key Principles:**
- Water follows path of least resistance
- Gravel provides easy flow channel
- Perforations allow water entry
- Slope ensures continuous movement
- System relieves hydrostatic pressure

## Types of Drainage Tile Installations

### 1. Exterior Drainage Systems

**Traditional Footing Drains**
