# What is an Egress Window? Understanding Basement Safety Requirements

An egress window is a window large enough and accessible enough to serve as an emergency exit in case of fire or other emergencies. In Toronto and throughout Ontario, egress windows are mandatory in certain basement spaces to ensure occupant safety and meet building code requirements.

## Definition and Purpose

### What Makes a Window an "Egress" Window?

An egress window must meet specific size and accessibility requirements that allow:
- **Emergency exit**: Large enough for an average adult to climb through
- **Emergency entry**: Accessible for firefighters wearing equipment
- **Natural light and ventilation**: Minimum requirements for habitable spaces

### Primary Functions
1. **Life Safety**: Provides secondary escape route
2. **Rescue Access**: Allows emergency responders to enter
3. **Code Compliance**: Meets legal requirements for bedrooms
4. **Natural Light**: Fulfills minimum daylight requirements
5. **Ventilation**: Provides required fresh air circulation

## Building Code Requirements in Ontario

### Ontario Building Code (OBC) Specifications

The Ontario Building Code mandates egress windows in:
- All bedrooms below grade (basement bedrooms)
- Sleeping areas in basements
- Any habitable room without direct grade-level access

### Minimum Size Requirements

**Window Opening Dimensions:**
- **Minimum clear opening**: 0.35 mÂ² (3.77 sq ft)
- **Minimum opening height**: 600 mm (24 inches)
- **Minimum opening width**: 550 mm (21.7 inches)
- **Maximum sill height**: 1,000 mm (39 inches) above floor

**Important**: No dimension can be less than 380 mm (15 inches)

### Location Requirements
- Must be accessible without special tools
- Cannot be blocked by furniture or storage
- Must open directly to the exterior
- Clear path to public way required

## Types of Egress Windows

### 1. Casement Windows
**Characteristics:**
- Side-hinged, open outward
- Provide maximum opening area
- Easier to meet size requirements
- Popular choice for basements

**Advantages:**
- Full opening width
- Easy operation
- Good ventilation
- Energy efficient

### 2. Sliding Windows
**Characteristics:**
- Horizontal sliding operation
- Only half the window opens
- Requires larger overall size
- More challenging for egress

**Considerations:**
- Must be extra wide
- Limited opening area
- May need custom sizing
- Check local codes

### 3. Single/Double Hung Windows
**Characteristics:**
- Vertical sliding operation
- Bottom sash moves up
- Traditional appearance
- Challenging for egress

**Requirements:**
- Need taller dimensions
- May require larger frame
- Consider ease of operation
- Sash locks must be accessible

### 4. Awning Windows
**Characteristics:**
- Top-hinged, open outward
- Limited opening height
- Not ideal for egress
- Usually combined with fixed windows

**Limitations:**
- Rarely meet height requirements alone
- Better as supplementary windows
- Consider combination units

### 5. In-Swing Windows
**Characteristics:**
- Open into the room
- Full opening access
- Less common design
- May interfere with interior space

**Special Considerations:**
- Requires interior clearance
- Different hardware needs
- May affect furniture placement

## Window Well Requirements

### When Window Wells are Needed
Window wells are required when:
- Window is below grade level

- Proper drainage is needed
- Light access must be maintained

### Window Well Specifications

**Minimum Dimensions:**
- **Width**: Window width plus 600 mm (24 inches)
- **Projection**: 900 mm (36 inches) from foundation
- **Depth**: To bottom of window opening

**Drainage Requirements:**
- Gravel base minimum 150 mm (6 inches)
- Connected to drainage tile if available
- Proper grading away from window
- Consider drain to sump pit

### Ladder and Step Requirements
**When Required:**
- Window wells deeper than 1,200 mm (48 inches)
- Must have permanent ladder or steps

**Specifications:**
