### Seasonal Pricing Factors
- **Spring/Summer**: Base pricing (high demand)
- **Fall**: 5-10% premium (weather risks)
- **Winter**: 15-25% premium (heating, protection needed)

## Cost Comparison: Concrete vs Alternatives

- Mark utility lines in advance

## Red Flags: Avoiding Concrete Scams

Watch out for quotes that:

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How thick should a concrete driveway be?
Minimum 4 inches for passenger vehicles, 5-6 inches for heavier vehicles. In Toronto's freeze-thaw climate, 5 inches provides better longevity.

### How much does stamped concrete cost vs regular concrete?
Stamped concrete costs $15-25/sq ft compared to $7-12 for standard concrete. The extra $8-13/sq ft covers patterns, colors, and sealing.

### Is concrete or asphalt cheaper for driveways?
Asphalt is cheaper initially ($3-7/sq ft) but requires resealing every 3-5 years and replacement every 15-20 years. Concrete costs more upfront but lasts 30-50 years.

### What's included in concrete driveway cost?
Professional quotes should include excavation, gravel base, forms, reinforcement, concrete delivery, pouring, finishing, control joints, and cleanup.

### How much concrete do I need for my driveway?
Calculate: Length × Width × Thickness (in feet) ÷ 27 = cubic yards needed. Add 10% for waste. A 20×30 ft driveway at 4" thick needs 7.4 + 10% = 8.1 cubic yards.
