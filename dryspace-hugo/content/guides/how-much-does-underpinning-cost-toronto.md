## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why does underpinning cost so much?

Underpinning is complex structural work requiring engineering, skilled labor, and careful execution. The high cost reflects the expertise, equipment, materials, and risk management needed to safely modify your home's foundation.

### Can I finance underpinning?

Yes, most homeowners use HELOCs, refinancing, or construction loans. With Toronto property values, banks readily lend for underpinning. The added space and rental income often justify the investment.

### How accurate are these estimates?

These prices reflect actual 2025 Toronto projects. However, every home is unique. Factors like foundation type, access, and soil conditions can vary costs by 20-30%. Get multiple detailed quotes for accuracy.

### Is underpinning worth the cost?

In Toronto's market, absolutely. Adding 700 sq ft of legal living space for $120,000 (about $170/sq ft) compares to buying that space for $800-1,200/sq ft. Plus, rental income provides immediate returns.

### What's included in the square foot price?

Basic pricing includes excavation, underpinning, and new floor. Standard pricing adds waterproofing. Premium includes full basement finishing. Always clarify what's included when comparing quotes.

### Can I reduce costs by doing some work myself?

The structural work requires licensed professionals for safety and permits. You might save on finishing work, but DIY won't significantly reduce the main underpinning costs.
