## Final Advice

Selecting an underpinning contractor is one of your most important home improvement decisions. Take time, do research, and trust your instincts. The lowest price is rarely the best value, and the smoothest salesperson isn't necessarily the best contractor.

Remember: You're not just hiring someone to dig a hole‚Äîyou're trusting them with your home's structural integrity and your family's safety.

<div class="expert-tip">
  <h3>üí° Expert Tip</h3>
  <p>The best underpinning contractors are usually booked 2-3 months out. If someone can start immediately, ask why they're not busy. Good contractors have waiting lists for a reason.</p>
