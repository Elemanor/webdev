# French Drains & Weeping Tile: Your Complete Drainage System Guide

Understanding foundation drainage is crucial for protecting your Toronto home from water damage. Whether you call it French drain, weeping tile, or drain tile, these systems serve the same critical purpose: keeping water away from your foundation. This comprehensive guide explains everything you need to know about these essential drainage solutions.

## Understanding the Terminology

### What's the Difference?

**The Truth**: French drains and weeping tile are essentially the same system with different names and slight variations in application.

**French Drain**
- Named after Henry French (1850s American farmer)
- General term for gravel-filled drainage trenches
- Can be used anywhere on property
- Often refers to surface/yard drainage

**Weeping Tile**
- Named after original clay tile construction
- Specifically refers to foundation drainage
- Always installed at foundation level
- Canadian terminology preference

**Modern Reality**: Both use perforated pipe in gravel beds to collect and redirect water.

## How Drainage Systems Work

### Basic Operating Principles

All foundation drainage operates on simple physics:

1. **Water Collection**: Perforations allow groundwater entry
2. **Path of Least Resistance**: Gravel provides easy flow channel
3. **Gravity Flow**: Proper slope moves water away (1% minimum)
4. **Pressure Relief**: Reduces hydrostatic pressure on foundation
5. **Safe Discharge**: Water directed to appropriate outlet

### System Components

**Essential Elements:**
- **Perforated Pipe**: 4-6 inch diameter PVC or corrugated
- **Drainage Aggregate**: ¾" to 1½" washed gravel
- **Filter Fabric**: Prevents soil/silt infiltration
- **Proper Slope**: Minimum 1/8" per foot fall
- **Discharge System**: Sump pump or gravity outlet

## Types of Drainage Systems

### 4. French Drains (Yard/Surface)

**Location**: Problem areas in yard

**Best For**:
- Low spots/pooling water
- Driveway runoff
- Downspout extensions
- General yard drainage

**Advantages**:
- Versatile placement
- Relatively simple installation
- Can be DIY project
- Immediate results

**Disadvantages**:
- Limited depth effectiveness
- Requires maintenance
- Can clog with surface debris

**Cost**: $25-75 per linear foot

## Installation Process

### Exterior Foundation Drainage

**Step 1: Excavation**

- Connect to discharge
- Verify proper slope

**Step 4: Backfilling**
- Cover with gravel (12"+)
- Install filter fabric
- Add drainage stone
- Replace soil in lifts

**Timeline**: 3-5 days per side

### Interior Drainage Installation

**Step 1: Preparation**
- Remove perimeter flooring
- Cut concrete channel
- Excavate below floor
- Create sump pit

**Step 2: System Installation**
- Lay gravel base
- Install perforated pipe
- Connect to sump pit
- Test water flow

**Step 3: Restoration**
- Cover with gravel
