## What is Masonry? Definition and Overview

Masonry is the building of structures from individual units, which are often laid in and bound together by mortar. It's both a construction method and an art form that involves:

- **Laying individual units** (bricks, stones, concrete blocks)
- **Binding with mortar** (cement-based adhesive)
- **Creating structures** (walls, foundations, chimneys, patios)
- **Decorative elements** (facades, fireplaces, walkways)

### Key Characteristics of Masonry
1. **Load-bearing capability** - Can support significant weight
2. **Weather resistance** - Withstands rain, wind, and temperature changes
3. **Fire resistance** - Non-combustible materials
4. **Longevity** - Properly built masonry lasts centuries
5. **Low maintenance** - Requires minimal upkeep

## Types of Masonry Materials

### 1. Brick Masonry
**What is Brick?**
Bricks are rectangular blocks made from clay or shale, fired in kilns at high temperatures. They're the most common masonry material in residential construction.

**Types of Bricks:**
- **Clay bricks** - Traditional red/brown bricks
- **Concrete bricks** - Made from concrete mix
- **Fire bricks** - Heat-resistant for fireplaces
- **Engineering bricks** - High strength, low absorption

**Common Uses:**
- Exterior walls
- Chimneys
- Fireplaces
- Walkways and patios
- Decorative facades

### 2. Stone Masonry
**What is Stone Masonry?**
Stone masonry uses natural stones cut or shaped to fit together. It's one of the oldest and most durable construction methods.

**Types of Stone:**
- **Granite** - Extremely durable, decorative
- **Limestone** - Easy to work, weather-resistant
- **Sandstone** - Attractive, varies in hardness
- **Fieldstone** - Natural, irregular shapes
- **Flagstone** - Flat stones for paving

**Applications:**
- Foundation walls
- Retaining walls
- Patios and walkways
- Building facades
- Landscaping features

### 3. Concrete Block Masonry
**What is a Concrete Block?**
Concrete blocks (CMUs - Concrete Masonry Units) are precast concrete units used for structural and non-structural applications.

**Types of Concrete Blocks:**
- **Hollow blocks** - Standard, lightweight
- **Solid blocks** - Heavy-duty applications
- **Aerated blocks** - Lightweight, insulating
- **Split-face blocks** - Decorative texture

**Uses:**
- Foundation walls
- Retaining walls
- Commercial buildings
- Sound barriers
- Fire walls

### 4. Veneer Masonry
**What is Brick Veneer?**
Veneer masonry is a non-structural facing of brick, stone, or manufactured materials attached to a backing.

**Types:**
- **Brick veneer** - Thin brick facing
- **Stone veneer** - Natural or manufactured
- **Stucco** - Cement-based coating
- **Cultured stone** - Manufactured stone appearance

## What Does a Mason Do?

Masons are skilled tradespeople who work with masonry materials. Their responsibilities include:

### Planning and Preparation
- Reading blueprints and specifications
- Calculating material requirements
- Setting up scaffolding and work areas

### Construction Tasks
- **Laying units** - Placing bricks/stones/blocks in patterns
- **Mixing mortar** - Creating proper consistency
- **Cutting materials** - Shaping units to fit
- **Setting levels** - Ensuring straight, plumb walls
- **Pointing/jointing** - Finishing mortar joints

### Specialized Work
- **Restoration** - Repairing historic masonry
- **Tuckpointing** - Replacing deteriorated mortar
- **Waterproofing** - Applying sealants and barriers
- **Decorative work** - Creating patterns and designs

## Common Masonry Construction Projects
