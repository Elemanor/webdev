# What is a Backwater Valve? Your Defense Against Sewer Backup

A backwater valve (also called a backflow preventer or sewer backup valve) is a one-way valve installed in your sewer line that allows wastewater to flow out of your home but prevents it from backing up into your basement during heavy rains or sewer surges. For Toronto homeowners, it's becoming an essential protection against costly sewage backup damage.

## How Backwater Valves Work

### Basic Operating Principle

The valve operates on a simple mechanism:
1. **Normal flow**: Wastewater flows out freely
2. **Backflow condition**: Reverse flow triggers closure
3. **Gate/flap closes**: Prevents sewage entry
4. **Pressure subsides**: Valve reopens automatically
5. **Protection maintained**: No manual intervention needed

### Key Components

**Main Parts:**
- **Valve body**: Durable housing (PVC/ABS)
- **Gate or flap**: Closes against backflow
- **Hinge mechanism**: Allows movement
- **Gasket seal**: Watertight closure
- **Access cover**: For maintenance
- **Flow direction arrow**: Proper installation guide

## Types of Backwater Valves

### 1. Normally Open Backwater Valves

**Most Common Type**

**Features:**
