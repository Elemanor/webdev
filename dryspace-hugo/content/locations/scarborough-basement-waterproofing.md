## Scarborough's Unique Waterproofing Challenges

After completing over 2,100 waterproofing projects across Scarborough, we've become experts in the specific challenges that make this area particularly demanding for basement protection.

### The Scarborough Clay Problem

Scarborough sits on some of Toronto's most challenging clay soil:

**Extreme Expansion Properties**
- Expands up to 35% when wet (highest in GTA)
- Contracts severely in drought
- Creates pressure up to 6,000 PSF on foundations
- Causes more foundation movement than anywhere in Toronto

**Why This Matters:**
- Standard waterproofing often fails
- Flexible systems essential
- Regular solutions crack under movement
- Requires Scarborough-specific engineering

### Geographic Challenges

**The Bluffs Effect**
Properties near the Scarborough Bluffs face:
- Natural erosion patterns
- Underground water movement
- Unstable soil conditions
- Higher insurance requirements

**Highland Creek Watershed**
- Affects huge swaths of Scarborough
- Natural flooding zones
- High water table areas
- Storm surge vulnerability

**Rouge River Influence**
- Eastern properties affected
- Seasonal flooding patterns
- Groundwater fluctuations
- Ravine lot complications

### Infrastructure Age by Neighborhood

**1950s-1960s Subdivisions** (Cliffcrest, Birchcliff)
- Original tar "waterproofing" failed
- Clay tile drains collapsed
- Foundation settling common
- Average repair cost: $7,500-$10,000

**1970s Boom** (Agincourt, Milliken)
- Builder-grade waterproofing expired
- First generation sump pumps failing
- Block foundation issues
- Average repair cost: $6,000-$8,500

**1980s-1990s Growth** (Malvern, Morningside)
- Better initial construction
- But reaching 30-40 year mark
- Membrane failures starting
- Average repair cost: $5,500-$7,500

## Recent Scarborough Success Stories

## Scarborough-Specific FAQs

<div class="faq-section">

**Q: How does Scarborough's clay soil affect my basement?**
A: Scarborough has the most expansive clay in the GTA. It can expand 35% when wet, creating enormous pressure on foundations. This causes cracks, water infiltration, and even structural movement. Our FlexGuard‚Ñ¢ system is specifically designed for this challenge.

**Q: Are properties near Highland Creek at higher risk?**
A: Yes. The Highland Creek watershed affects large areas of Scarborough with higher water tables and increased flood risk. We've waterproofed hundreds of homes in these areas and understand the specific solutions needed.

**Q: Why do Scarborough basements flood more during storms?**
A: Combination of clay soil that doesn't absorb water, aging storm sewers, and increased development creating runoff. Plus, many areas have high water tables. Modern sump pump systems with battery backup are essential.

**Q: Is the Scarborough Bluffs area particularly challenging?**
A: Absolutely. Natural erosion, underground water movement, and unstable soil conditions make this one of our most challenging areas. We use specialized techniques and have extensive experience with Bluffs properties.

**Q: What about newer homes in Scarborough?**
A: Even homes built in the 1990s-2000s are starting to show waterproofing failures. Builder-grade waterproofing typically lasts 15-25 years. We recommend inspection if you're seeing any signs of moisture.
