## York's Unique Waterproofing Challenges

York's rich history creates distinct waterproofing challenges. With the highest concentration of pre-1950 homes in Toronto and the notorious Black Creek running through it, York requires specialized expertise we've developed over 1,234 local projects.

### Century Home Foundations

York's heritage creates specific issues:

**Stone & Rubble Foundations (Pre-1920s)**
- No footings in many homes
- Deteriorating mortar joints
- Irregular surfaces
- Requires gentle techniques
- Cannot use standard methods

**Early Concrete (1920s-1940s)**
- Lower quality than modern
- Extensive deterioration
- Multiple patch repairs
- Honeycombing common
- Special repair methods needed

**Our Expertise:**
- Preservation techniques
- Structural stabilization
- Historical accuracy
- Modern protection methods

### Black Creek: York's Water Challenge

The Black Creek watershed affects huge areas:

**Chronic Flooding Zones**
- Jane & Wilson area
- Weston Road corridor
- Mount Dennis
- Rockcliffe-Smythe
- Regular overflows

**Why Black Creek Floods:**
- Concrete channel overwhelmed
- Urban runoff acceleration
- Combined sewer overflows
- Climate change impacts
- Predicted to worsen

**Affected Properties:**
- Within 500m of creek: Extreme risk

- Watershed area: Moderate risk
- Requires specialized systems

### Urban Density Challenges

York's urban development creates issues:

**Combined Sewers**
- Storm + sanitary in same pipe

## York-Specific FAQs

<div class="faq-section">

**Q: Can you waterproof my 100+ year old stone foundation?**
A: Absolutely. We've successfully waterproofed over 400 century homes in York. Stone foundations require specialized techniques that preserve the structure while providing modern protection. Our heritage package is designed specifically for this.

**Q: How bad is the Black Creek flooding risk?**
A: Properties within 1km of Black Creek face significant flood risk that's increasing with climate change. The creek overwhelms during heavy rain. Our flood defense systems are specifically engineered for Black Creek conditions.

**Q: My York row house has shared walls. Can you help?**
A: Yes, we specialize in York's dense urban housing. We use interior methods that don't affect neighbors, coordinate when needed, and can arrange group discounts for multiple units.

**Q: Do you understand heritage preservation requirements?**
A: Completely. We work with heritage consultants and have extensive experience meeting preservation standards while providing full waterproofing protection. Many Baby Point and Humewood clients specifically choose us for this expertise.

**Q: What about York's combined sewers backing up?**
A: Major issue in older York neighborhoods. We always recommend backwater valves (city rebate available) and design systems to handle sewer backup scenarios. This is standard in our York installations.
