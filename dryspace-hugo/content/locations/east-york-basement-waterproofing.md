## East York's Distinct Waterproofing Challenges

East York's identity as Toronto's only former borough creates unique waterproofing challenges. With most homes built during the post-war boom (1945-1965), we see consistent patterns that require specialized expertise developed over 987 local projects.

### The Post-War Construction Challenge

East York's building boom created specific issues:

**Concrete Block Foundations (65% of homes)**
- Hollow cores trap water
- Mortar joints deteriorate
- More porous than poured concrete
- Require specialized sealing techniques

**Construction Shortcuts of the Era**
- Minimal waterproofing (tar coating only)
- Shallow foundations (code was different)
- Clay tile drains (now collapsed)
- Thinner basement floors

**Why This Matters:**
- Standard repairs often fail
- Water finds multiple paths
- Requires comprehensive approach
- Block-specific solutions essential

### East York's Unique Geography

**Taylor Creek Influence**
- Affects Woodbine Gardens area
- Underground water movement
- Seasonal flooding patterns
- Higher water tables

**Don Valley Proximity**
- Eastern neighborhoods affected
- Slope-related water issues
- Natural drainage patterns altered
- Spring melt concerns

**Urban Density Factors**
- Smaller lots = drainage challenges
- Shared driveways common
- Limited equipment access
- Neighbor coordination needed

### Infrastructure at Critical Age

**60-80 Year Old Systems**
- Original waterproofing expired
- Clay sewer pipes cracking
- Foundation settlement common
- Multiple repair attempts typical

**The Multiplication Effect**
- Small problems compound quickly
- Previous DIY repairs complicate
- Water finds new paths
- Comprehensive solutions needed

## East York FAQs

<div class="faq-section">

**Q: Why do East York's concrete block foundations leak so much?**
A: Block foundations have hollow cores that trap water. Combined with deteriorating mortar joints and 60+ years of freeze-thaw cycles, they become very porous. Our block-specific solutions address all these vulnerabilities.

**Q: Is East York's post-war construction particularly problematic?**
A: Yes. The rapid construction of 1945-1965 often used shortcuts - minimal waterproofing, thinner floors, clay drain tiles. These are all failing now. We specialize in updating these homes to modern standards.

**Q: Can you work in East York's tight lots?**
A: Absolutely. We've perfected techniques for narrow lots, shared driveways, and zero-clearance situations common in East York. Our compact equipment and interior-focused solutions work perfectly.

**Q: Do you understand 1950s construction methods?**
A: Completely. After 987 East York projects, we know every construction trend from that era - from the specific block types used to the typical foundation depths. This knowledge ensures effective repairs.

**Q: What about Taylor Creek flooding in Woodbine Gardens?**
A: We've waterproofed dozens of homes in the Taylor Creek watershed. These require higher-capacity systems and specific drainage solutions we've perfected over the years.
