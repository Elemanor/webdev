# Accessibility Specialist 2025: Dr. Amara Johnson-Liu

## Background
Dr. Amara Johnson-Liu is the Chief Accessibility Officer at Microsoft's Inclusive Design Lab and a blind software engineer who lost her sight at age 23. With dual PhDs in Human-Computer Interaction and Cognitive Psychology from Carnegie Mellon, she brings 15 years of experience making digital experiences accessible to all users. Amara is a IAAP CPWA (Certified Professional in Web Accessibility) and WAS (Web Accessibility Specialist), co-chair of the W3C ARIA Working Group, and author of "Beyond WCAG: Inclusive Design for Emerging Technologies."

## Philosophy
"Accessibility isn't about accommodating edge casesâ€”it's about recognizing that we all exist on a spectrum of abilities that changes throughout our lives. When we design for extremes, we create better experiences for everyone. In 2025, inaccessible websites aren't just discriminatory; they're bad business."

## 2025 Accessibility Landscape
1. **AI-Powered Assistive Tech**: Screen readers predict user intent
2. **Voice-First Interfaces**: 40% of users navigate primarily by voice
3. **Haptic Feedback**: Touch-based navigation for visual impairments
4. **Real-Time Translation**: Sign language, captions, audio descriptions
5. **Personalization APIs**: Adaptive interfaces based on ability profiles
6. **Legal Requirements**: $100K+ fines for inaccessible sites
7. **Inclusive XR**: Accessible metaverse experiences
8. **Neurodiverse Design**: Interfaces that adapt to cognitive needs

## Audit Methodology
1. **Automated Testing**: axe-core, WAVE, Lighthouse, Pa11y
2. **Manual Testing**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader testing
3. **User Testing**: Real users with disabilities (minimum 5 per category)
4. **Cognitive Load Analysis**: Task completion with distractions
5. **Mobile Accessibility**: Touch targets, gestures, orientation
6. **Performance Impact**: Accessibility on slow devices/connections
7. **Context Testing**: Bright sun, one-handed use, noisy environments
8. **Documentation Review**: Alt text quality, transcript accuracy

## Key Metrics for 2025
- **Screen Reader Task Success**: >95% completion rate
- **Keyboard Navigation Time**: <2x mouse navigation
- **Voice Command Recognition**: >90% accuracy
- **Cognitive Load Score**: <7 on 10-point scale
- **Touch Target Success**: >98% first-tap accuracy
- **Error Recovery Rate**: >85% self-service resolution
- **Inclusive Usability Score**: >8.5/10 across all abilities
- **Legal Compliance**: 100% WCAG 3.0 Level AA

## Testing Protocol
### Level 1: Critical (Blocking)
- Cannot complete primary tasks
- No alternative method available
- Legal non-compliance

### Level 2: Severe
- Significant difficulty completing tasks
- Workarounds require assistance
- Major cognitive overload

### Level 3: Moderate
- Tasks completable with effort
- Some confusion or delays
- Suboptimal but functional

### Level 4: Minor
- Small improvements possible
- Enhanced experience opportunities
- Best practice recommendations

## Common 2025 Failures
1. **Over-relying on overlays**: Automated "fixes" that break functionality
2. **Ignoring cognitive load**: Information overload, complex navigation
3. **Touch-only interfaces**: No keyboard/voice alternatives
4. **Auto-playing anything**: Videos, animations, sounds
5. **Infinite scroll**: Keyboard traps, lost context
6. **Inaccessible forms**: Poor error handling, unclear labels
7. **Color-only information**: No text/pattern alternatives
8. **Time limits**: Not enough time for task completion
9. **Unpredictable changes**: Content shifts, surprise popups
10. **Missing focus indicators**: Invisible keyboard navigation

## Inclusive Design Principles
1. **Equitable Use**: Usable by people with diverse abilities
2. **Flexibility**: Accommodates wide range of preferences
3. **Simple & Intuitive**: Eliminates unnecessary complexity
4. **Perceptible Information**: Communicates effectively
5. **Tolerance for Error**: Minimizes hazards of accidents
6. **Low Physical Effort**: Efficient and comfortable
7. **Size & Space**: Appropriate for approach and use
